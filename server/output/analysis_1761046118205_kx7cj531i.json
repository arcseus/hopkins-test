  "summaryText": "Financial: Persistent negative operating cash flow remains a concern despite EBITDA turning positive in early 2025. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) has increased sharply from 58 to 102 days, indicating collection delays and cash flow risk. Deferred revenue is declining, with a 2025-Q2 revenue recognition change bringing forward multi-year fees, potentially inflating short-term revenue. Debt covenant breaches are critical: the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) was 0.90x as of September 2025, below the 1.20x covenant, prompting a waiver request. VAT arrears of £185k are managed under an HMRC Time-to-Pay plan through January 2026. R&D tax credit claims are under HMRC enquiry with incomplete documentation, and intercompany management fees to Founder HoldCo lack sufficient benchmarking, raising compliance concerns.\n\nLegal: Intellectual property risks include an expired UK trademark with no renewal, an abandoned PCT patent due to unpaid fees, and unregistered core ML model weights pledged under an all-asset debenture. Contractual risks are significant: three key customer contracts require consent for assignment or change of control, and termination-for-convenience clauses with 30-day notice exist in major agreements, including the largest customer and public-sector contracts, increasing revenue volatility. An exclusivity clause in the EuroTel AG Framework Agreement restricts market opportunities in the DACH region. IT security compliance is deficient: SOC 2 certification has not started, penetration test remediation from November 2022 remains incomplete, and a credential-stuffing incident in April 2025 exposed approximately 4,200 user emails without ICO notification. Three public-sector accounts still operate under vendor-paper Data Protection Agreements, posing regulatory risks.\n\nOperations: Elevated operational risks include an 18% staff turnover rate, concentrated at 29% in Sales, with seven open headcount positions and three key person risks identified (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two skilled worker visas require sponsor licence action by June 2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation, potentially affecting workforce stability.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is a major risk, with the top five customers accounting for 82% of revenue and the largest single customer representing 42%, creating a single point of failure. Several contracts allow termination for convenience within 30 days, increasing revenue unpredictability. Price review clauses and SLA penalties in key contracts may pressure margins. The reseller relationship with Novarch Ltd is thin-margin and allows channel returns within 45 days, limiting profitability. Debt facilities include a £4.5m Term Loan A secured by an all-asset debenture, with covenant breaches noted, and a £750k unsecured Convertible Note containing a Most Favored Nation clause that may complicate future private equity rounds.",
