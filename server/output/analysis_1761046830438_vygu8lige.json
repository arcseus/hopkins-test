  "summaryText": "Financial: Key financial red flags include persistent negative operating cash flow despite EBITDA turning positive, with cash flow improving from -£450k to -£220k but remaining negative through 2025Q3. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) has stretched significantly from 58 to 102 days, indicating collection delays. Deferred revenue declined due to upfront recognition of multi-year fees, affecting revenue quality. Debt covenant breaches are critical: Term Loan A’s DSCR fell to 0.90x versus a 1.20x covenant, prompting a waiver request. VAT arrears of £185k exist with an HMRC Time-to-Pay plan active, and R&D tax credit claims are under HMRC enquiry with incomplete documentation. Convertible notes carry risks including 8% PIK interest and a Most Favored Nation clause that may impact future equity rounds.\n\nLegal: Contractual and IP risks are significant. Multiple key contracts include 30-day termination-for-convenience clauses and require consent for assignment or change of control, limiting flexibility and increasing instability. Exclusivity clauses restrict market opportunities. IP concerns include an expired UK trademark with no renewal, an abandoned patent due to unpaid fees, and core machine learning model weights pledged under an all-asset debenture. Data protection compliance is incomplete: a credential stuffing incident exposed 4,200 user emails without ICO notification, SOC 2 certification has not started, and penetration testing is outdated. Audit rights granted to resellers may expose sensitive data. Overall, 8 red flags span contracts, IP, and compliance.\n\nOperations: Operational risks include a 12-month staff turnover rate of 18%, concentrated at 29% in Sales, with 7 open positions and 3 key person dependencies (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two employees depend on Skilled Worker visas with a sponsor licence action plan due by mid-2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation. IT security gaps persist with incomplete penetration testing, delayed SOC 2 certification, and incomplete data protection agreements for public-sector clients.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is a major risk, with the top 5 customers representing 82% of revenue and the largest customer alone accounting for 42%, creating a single point-of-failure. Several contracts allow termination for convenience on short notice, and some include price review clauses permitting downward adjustments. Margins are thin with certain resellers. Intercompany management fees to Founder HoldCo lack benchmarking, raising transfer pricing concerns. Debt facilities secured by an all-asset debenture include intellectual property, increasing asset risk.\n\nIn summary, the company faces material financial liquidity and covenant risks, legal uncertainties around contracts and IP, operational vulnerabilities in talent and IT security, and commercial concentration risks requiring active management.",
