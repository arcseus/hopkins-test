# VDR Lite — Diligence Summary
_Date: 2025-10-21_

## Summary

Financial: Key financial red flags include sustained negative EBITDA and operating cash flow for the first five quarters, despite recent improvements. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) has increased significantly from 58 to 102 days, indicating collection delays. Deferred revenue is declining, with upfront recognition of multi-year fees potentially distorting revenue trends. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) covenant was breached at 0.90x versus a 1.20x requirement, leading to a waiver request. VAT arrears of £185k and an HMRC Time-to-Pay plan through January 2026 highlight tax payment issues. Additionally, incomplete documentation and an ongoing HMRC enquiry on R&D claims pose compliance risks. Intercompany management fees to Founder HoldCo lack sufficient benchmarking, raising transfer pricing concerns. Legal: Four major legal red flags are present. The UK trademark "Highland Analytics" expired without renewal, and a key patent was abandoned due to unpaid fees, weakening intellectual property protection. The copyright on core machine learning model weights is unregistered and pledged under an all-asset debenture, limiting asset security. Contractual risks include termination-for-convenience clauses with 30-day notice in major agreements, exclusivity provisions restricting market opportunities in the DACH region, and assignment restrictions requiring prior consent. SOC 2 certification has not been initiated, and penetration test findings from November 2022 remain only partially remediated, with a re-test scheduled for H1 2026. A data breach in April 2025 exposed approximately 4,200 user emails without ICO notification, and public-sector accounts remain on vendor-paper Data Protection Agreements, indicating incomplete GDPR compliance. Operations: Operational risks include a 12-month staff turnover rate of 18%, concentrated at 29% in Sales, with seven open headcount positions and three key person risks identified (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two employees depend on Skilled Worker visas with a sponsor licence action plan due by June 2025. An open harassment claim is currently in early conciliation, potentially affecting workforce stability. Commercial: Customer concentration risk is high, with the top five customers representing 82% of revenue and the largest single customer accounting for 42%, combined with 30-day termination-for-convenience clauses increasing churn risk. Several contracts include price review clauses, SLA penalties up to 15%, and exclusivity or MFN provisions limiting pricing flexibility. The unsecured £750,000 convertible note carries 8% PIK interest and an MFN clause that may complicate future private equity rounds. The revolving credit facility is partially drawn, and covenant breaches on the term loan raise refinancing concerns. Overall, material risks span financial stability, legal compliance, operational resilience, and commercial concentration, requiring active management and mitigation.
