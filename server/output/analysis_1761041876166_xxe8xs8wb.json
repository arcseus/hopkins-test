  "summaryText": "Financial: Key financial red flags include persistent negative operating cash flow, improving from -£450k to -£220k but remaining negative throughout all quarters. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased significantly from 58 to 102 days, indicating delayed collections and stretched receivables. A revenue recognition change in 2025-Q2 introduced upfront multi-year fees of +£250k, potentially inflating revenue. The Term Loan A covenant breach is critical, with a DSCR of 0.90x versus the required 1.20x, leading to a waiver request. VAT arrears of £185k and an HMRC Time-to-Pay plan through January 2026 highlight tax compliance risks. R&D tax credit claims are under HMRC enquiry with incomplete documentation, and intercompany management fees lack sufficient benchmarking, raising transfer pricing concerns.\n\nLegal: Multiple legal red flags arise from intellectual property and compliance issues. The UK trademark \"Highland Analytics\" expired without renewal, and a key patent was abandoned due to unpaid fees. Core machine learning model weights are pledged under an all-asset debenture. Contractual risks include termination-for-convenience clauses with 30-day notice in key customer and reseller agreements, exclusivity clauses limiting market opportunities in the DACH region, and restrictive assignment provisions requiring prior consent. SOC 2 certification has not started, and the last penetration test from November 2022 revealed medium-severity findings that remain unaddressed. A data breach in April 2025 exposed approximately 4,200 user emails, with no notification to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Public-sector contracts still rely on vendor-paper Data Protection Agreements, indicating incomplete GDPR compliance.\n\nOperations: Operational risks include a 12-month staff turnover rate of 18%, concentrated at 29% in Sales, with seven open headcount positions and three key person risks identified (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two skilled worker visas require sponsor licence action by June 2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation. IT security gaps persist with incomplete penetration testing and delayed SOC 2 certification, exposing the company to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is high, with the top customer representing 42% of revenue and holding a 30-day convenience termination clause, posing revenue stability risks. Several contracts allow unilateral termination and include change-of-control consent requirements, limiting flexibility. Price review clauses and SLA penalties up to 15% monthly fees with certain customers may impact margins. The reseller agreement with Novarch Ltd shows thin margins and channel return rights within 45 days. Debt facilities include a convertible note with a Most Favored Nation clause potentially complicating future private equity rounds, and a revolving credit facility with restrictive clean-down covenants affecting liquidity.\n\nIn summary, the company faces significant financial covenant breaches, tax and IP risks, cybersecurity and compliance gaps, operational staffing challenges, and substantial customer concentration with contractual inflexibilities, all requiring active management and mitigation.",
