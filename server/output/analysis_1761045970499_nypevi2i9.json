  "summaryText": "Financial: Key financial risks include a breach of the Term Loan A DSCR covenant (0.90x vs. 1.20x required) with a waiver requested in October 2025. Operating cash flow remains negative despite EBITDA turning positive in early 2025. Deferred revenue declined from £1.1m to £880k, and days sales outstanding (DSO) stretched from 58 to 102 days, indicating collection delays and cash flow pressure. VAT arrears of £185k are outstanding, with a HMRC Time-to-Pay plan through January 2026. R&D tax credit claims for FY2023–FY2024 are under HMRC enquiry due to incomplete documentation. The unsecured £750k Convertible Note includes a Most Favored Nation clause, potentially complicating future private equity rounds.\n\nLegal: Several contract-related red flags exist across three key agreements, including termination-for-convenience clauses with 30-day notice periods, consent requirements for assignment on change of control, and exclusivity clauses limiting flexibility and market opportunities. Intellectual property risks include an expired UK trademark with no renewal, an abandoned PCT patent due to unpaid fees, and an unregistered copyright pledged to a lender. IT security compliance gaps are significant: SOC 2 certification has not started, the last penetration test in November 2022 revealed medium-severity findings that remain unremediated, and an April 2025 data breach exposed approximately 4,200 user emails without ICO notification. Three public-sector accounts remain on vendor-paper Data Protection Agreements, indicating incomplete GDPR compliance.\n\nOperations: Operational challenges include stretched DSO and ongoing negative operating cash flow. Staff turnover is elevated at 18% annually, especially in Sales at 29%, with three key person risks identified (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two skilled worker visas require sponsor licence action by June 2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation. IT security weaknesses persist with pending SOC 2 certification and delayed penetration test remediation scheduled for H1 2026.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is high, with the top five customers representing 82% of revenue and the largest customer accounting for 42%, posing a single point-of-failure risk. Several contracts allow termination for convenience within 30 days, and some include SLA penalties up to 15% of monthly fees. Price review clauses and exclusivity agreements may exert downward pricing pressure and limit market opportunities. The reseller Novarch Ltd operates on thin margins with a 70/30 revenue share and channel return rights. Debt facilities are secured by an all-asset debenture including intellectual property, adding risk to key assets. These factors highlight significant revenue and operational risks requiring close monitoring.",
