  "summaryText": "Financial: Key financial red flags include persistent negative operating cash flow, improving from -£450k in 2024Q1 to -£220k in 2025Q3, despite EBITDA turning positive. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) has stretched from 58 to 102 days, indicating collection delays. Deferred revenue declined from £1.1m to £880k, and a 2025Q2 revenue recognition change brought forward multi-year fees, potentially inflating revenue. The Term Loan A covenant breach is critical, with a DSCR of 0.90x versus the required 1.20x as of September 2025, leading to a waiver request. VAT arrears of £185k remain, with an HMRC Time-to-Pay plan active through January 2026. An HMRC enquiry into R&D Expenditure Credit claims is ongoing, complicated by incomplete documentation.\n\nLegal: Several legal risks arise from contracts and intellectual property. Three material contracts present termination and exclusivity risks: the Master Services Agreement allows 30-day termination for convenience and change of control termination rights; the Framework Agreement with EuroTel AG imposes exclusivity limiting market access; reseller agreements include restrictive revenue-sharing and return terms. Intellectual property concerns include an expired UK trademark with no renewal, an abandoned patent due to unpaid fees, and unregistered copyright pledged to lenders. IT security compliance is weak: SOC 2 certification has not started, the last penetration test in 2022 revealed medium findings that remain unaddressed, and a 2025 data breach exposed ~4,200 user emails without ICO notification. Public-sector contracts still use outdated vendor-paper Data Protection Agreements, increasing regulatory risk.\n\nOperations: Operational red flags include a 12-month staff turnover rate of 18%, with 29% in Sales, and three key person risks (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two skilled worker visas require sponsor licence action by June 2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation. IT security gaps persist with delayed SOC 2 certification and incomplete penetration test remediation. The April 2025 credential-stuffing incident highlights vulnerabilities in data protection and incident response.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is a significant risk, with the top five customers accounting for 82% of revenue and the largest customer representing 42%. Several contracts allow termination with 30-day convenience notice and require consent for assignment or change of control, limiting transaction flexibility. Price review clauses and SLA penalties introduce revenue volatility. The unsecured £750k convertible note includes a Most Favored Nation clause, potentially complicating future private equity rounds. Open headcount and contractor reliance, alongside ongoing VAT and tax issues, add to commercial instability.",
