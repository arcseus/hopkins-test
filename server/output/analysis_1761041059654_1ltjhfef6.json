  "summaryText": "Financial: Persistent negative operating cash flow remains a concern despite improvement, with days sales outstanding (DSO) increasing from 58 to 102 days, indicating collection delays. Gross margin declined from 78% to 70%, and deferred revenue is falling. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) covenant on Term Loan A is breached at 0.90x against a 1.20x requirement, with a waiver requested. VAT arrears of £185k are outstanding, supported by an HMRC Time-to-Pay plan through January 2026. Incomplete documentation and an ongoing HMRC enquiry on R&D claims pose tax compliance risks. Intercompany management fees lack sufficient benchmarking, raising transfer pricing concerns.\n\nLegal: Key legal risks include three contracts with 30-day termination-for-convenience clauses, creating revenue uncertainty. Exclusivity clauses in the Framework Agreement limit market opportunities, and assignment restrictions may hinder contract transferability. Intellectual property issues comprise an expired UK trademark with no renewal, an abandoned patent due to unpaid fees, and an unregistered copyright pledged to a lender. IT security compliance gaps are significant: SOC 2 certification has not started, penetration test findings from November 2022 remain partially unaddressed, and a data breach exposed approximately 4,200 user emails without notification to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Data Protection Agreements cover only 61% of customers, leaving 39% incomplete.\n\nOperations: Operational risks include a 12-month staff turnover rate of 18%, with Sales turnover at 29%, and three key person dependencies identified (CTO, Lead ML, Head of Sales). Two employees depend on Skilled Worker visas with a sponsor licence action plan due by June 2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation. IT security weaknesses and incomplete data protection coverage further exacerbate operational vulnerabilities.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is high, with the top five customers representing 82% of revenue and the largest customer accounting for 42%. Several contracts allow termination for convenience within 30 days, and some include consent, most-favoured-nation, and exclusivity provisions that limit pricing flexibility and pose revenue risks. SLA penalties up to 15% of monthly fees may impact revenue. The reseller customer has thin margins, and credit terms vary from 45 to 60 days. Debt covenants and convertible note clauses may affect future financing rounds.\n\nOverall, material risks span financial stability, legal compliance, operational continuity, and commercial concentration. Immediate focus on cash flow, covenant compliance, intellectual property protection, contract renegotiation, and IT security is essential to mitigate potential adverse impacts.",
