  "summaryText": "Financial: Key financial concerns include a DSCR covenant breach on Term Loan A, with a ratio of 0.90x versus a 1.20x requirement, leading to a waiver request in October 2025. Operating cash flow remains negative despite EBITDA turning positive in early 2025. Deferred revenue declined from £1.1m to £880k, signaling potential revenue recognition timing risks, exacerbated by a 2025-Q2 policy change advancing multi-year fee recognition. VAT arrears of £185k are outstanding, with a HMRC Time-to-Pay plan active through January 2026. R&D tax credit claims for FY2023–FY2024 face HMRC enquiry due to incomplete documentation, and intercompany management fees to Founder HoldCo raise transfer pricing concerns.\n\nLegal: Several legal red flags arise from contract terms and intellectual property. Three contracts include 30-day termination-for-convenience clauses, increasing contract instability. Exclusivity provisions in the Framework Agreement restrict market access in the DACH region. Assignment restrictions and change-of-control consent requirements in key customer contracts limit flexibility. Intellectual property issues include an expired UK trademark without renewal, an abandoned PCT patent due to unpaid fees, and unregistered copyright pledged to lenders. IT security compliance is inadequate: SOC 2 certification has not started, the last penetration test in November 2022 revealed medium-severity findings that remain partially unaddressed, and a 2025 credential-stuffing incident exposed approximately 4,200 user emails without notifying the Information Commissioner’s Office.\n\nOperations: Operational risks include a stretched Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increasing from 58 to 102 days, reflecting collection delays. Staff turnover is elevated at 18% annually, with Sales turnover at 29%, and seven open headcount positions remain unfilled, including critical roles. Two employees rely on Skilled Worker visas with a sponsor licence action plan due by mid-2025. An open harassment claim is in early conciliation. Data protection agreements cover only 61% of customers, leaving 38% without coverage, increasing compliance risk.\n\nCommercial: Customer concentration is high, with the top five customers accounting for 82% of revenue and the largest single customer representing 42%. Several contracts permit termination with 30-day convenience notice, and some include price review clauses allowing downward adjustments. SLA penalties up to 15% of monthly fees apply with key clients. Debt includes a £4.5m Term Loan A secured by an all-asset debenture covering intellectual property, and a £750k unsecured convertible note with a Most Favored Nation clause that may complicate future private equity rounds. These factors, combined with financial and operational challenges, require close oversight.",
